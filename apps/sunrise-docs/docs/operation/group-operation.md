# 🔄 Group Operation

The Group Operation feature in Stageholder allows you to perform multiple changes on assets simultaneously. This is particularly useful for bulk operations such as audits, assignments, relocations, and transitions. By using Group Operation, you can save time and ensure consistency across your asset management processes.

## 🚀 Getting Started with Group Operation

To start using Group Operation:

1. Navigate to the **Group Operation** section.
2. Click on the **"Add Operation Group"** button located in the top right corner.
3. Provide a name for the operation group and select the tasks that the operation group will perform. Tasks can include audits, assignments, relocations, and transitions.
4. Save the operation group.

### 🛠️ Creating an Operation Group

1. **Name the Operation Group:** Choose a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the group (e.g., "Annual Audit 2024").
2. **Select Tasks:** Turn on the task bars based on what the operation needs to do. For example, if you need to perform both relocation and transition changes, enable both the relocation and transition tasks.
3. **Save the Operation Group:** Click the **"Save"** button to create the operation group.

## 🔄 Performing Group Operations

Once you have created an operation group, you can perform bulk operations on selected assets:

1. Navigate to the **Group Operation** section.
2. Select the operation group you created.
3. Click on **"Do Operation"** to start the bulk operation process.
4. Choose the fixed assets you want to include in the operation.
5. Configure the specific changes required for each task (e.g., new locations for relocations, new lifecycle stages for transitions).
6. Save the operation to apply the changes.

### 📋 Example: Relocation and Transition

Suppose you need to relocate and update the lifecycle stages of multiple assets:

1. **Relocation:** Choose the assets to relocate and specify the new locations. This could involve moving assets from one department to another or changing storage locations.
2. **Transition:** Update the lifecycle stages of the selected assets. For example, you might change the status from "In Use" to "Under Maintenance" or "Disposed."
